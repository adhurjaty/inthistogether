title: "Take Initiative"
value_name: "Take Initiative"
value_desc: "We actively work to identify opportunities to bring joy and support to others. Taking the time to listen to the needs of others, we ask for guidance, step up, speak out, and act boldly. We recognize the impact that our individual actions, big or small, can have on the world around us.  This mindset encourages us to lead by example and gives us the freedom to roll up our sleeves and blaze our own trails. Taking initiative is not about recognition, itâ€™s about acting with integrity, regardless of who is watching.
